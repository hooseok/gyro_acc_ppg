For the experiment, we developed a watch-type PPG measuring device. The developed device includes a 3-channel PPG sensor, an accelerometer and a gyroscope. For the acquisition of the PPG signal, photosensors (NJL5310R, NJR Corporation, Japan) integrating two green LEDs(wavelength: 525nm) and a photodetector was used. Three PPG sensors were placed at intervals of 6 mm. Acceleration and gyro values were collected using a 6-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU; LSM6DSMUSTR, STMicroelectronics). Three digital signals were stored using a micro-SD card. The three digital signals are simultaneously stored on a micro-SD card at a frequency of 50 Hz.

We conducted experiments with a modified version of the Bruce protocol, which consists of 2 min of walking as a warm-up, 3 min of running, 2 min of walking, 3 min of running, and 2 min of walking to cool down, all on a treadmill. During the running, the speed was set to 6.0 to 7.0 km/h. In the experiment, 24 healthy subjects at Wonkwang University were recruited by trained study personnel. In total, 10 males and 14 females with an average age of 26.9 ± 4.8 years participated. The protocol for data collection and analysis was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Wonkwang University. All participants provided written informed consent.

Exercise Experiment Protocol
==================================================
Measurements were taken using an ECG placed on the chest together with a PPG placed on the wrist during treadmill exercise. ECG data were recorded simultaneously using a 24-hour Holter monitor (SEER Light; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). PPG and motion data were recorded using a wearable device which we developed. Participants were asked to perform the exercise according to the exercise protocol, we have designed. 
  1) Stay (Resting)      : 1minutes
  2) Walking             : 2minutes, treadmill (2.5km/h)
  3) Running             : 3minutes, treadmill (6km/h)
  4) Walking             : 2minutes, treadmill (3km/h)
  5) Running             : 3minutes, treadmill (7km/h)
  6) Walking             : 2minutes, treadmill (2.5km/h)
  7) Stay (Resting)      : 1minutes

Data Description
==================================================
This database contains wrist PPGs recorded during stay, walking, and running.
Accelerometers and Gyroscopes are collected to remove the motion artifact from the PPGs.
A reference chest ECG is included to allow a gold-standard comparison of heart rate during treadmill exercise.
